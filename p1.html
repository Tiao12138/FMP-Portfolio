      <b>Overview:</b> An exhibition that stimulates conversation and makes the internet and its impact 
      on the environment less abstract and more understandable. With the aim stimulating (the design of) 
      thoughtful internet consumption. It consists of three exhibits. These are: (a) WiFinder; a device that can 
      detect Wi-Fi strength and translates it into sound and vibration, (b) Shop your data; a product where you 
      can input your data usage for a day and receive a receipt about the environmental impact it has, 
      (c) Infographic ; poster about the internet infrastructure and interesting facts. </br>
      <b>In cooperation with:</b> Bram Willems, Tessa van Abkoude, and Marc Wijkmans </br></br>
      <b>Refelction:</b> My contribution to this project includes: poster-making(90%), react app building(70%), 
      Exhibition setting(20%), Wifinder and scale prototyping(10%). I was trying out a lot of new things during 
      this project. I learned to work with people in a way that i wasn't familiar with, and learned to build a react 
      app based on JavaScript, and tried to adjust myself to the course structure in TU/e. It felt like a good start 
      of developing myself as a designer and I have gained a good amount of knowledge in a short time. </br></br>
