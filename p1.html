      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Creativiy and Aesthetic; Technology and Realization; User and Society.</br></br>
      <b>Overview:</b> An exhibition that stimulates conversation and makes the internet and its impact 
      on the environment less abstract and more understandable. With the aim stimulating (the design of) 
      thoughtful internet consumption. It consists of three exhibits. These are: (a) WiFinder; a device that can 
      detect Wi-Fi strength and translates it into sound and vibration, (b) Shop your data; a product where you 
      can input your data usage for a day and receive a receipt about the environmental impact it has, 
      (c) Infographic ; poster about the internet infrastructure and interesting facts. </br>
      <b>In cooperation with:</b> Bram Willems, Tessa van Abkoude, and Marc Wijkmans </br></br>
      <b>Reflection:</b> My contribution to this project includes: poster-making(90%), react app building(70%), 
      Exhibition setting(20%), Wifinder and scale prototyping(10%). </br>
      Real social issues happening around us stimulate me in a specific way. They are very provoking because 
      they are real. The environmental impact of data consumption is one such social issue. Working on this 
      topic made me observe my own behavior and discover many concrete design opportunities.</br>
      During the construction of the exhibition, a lot of first-person perspective studies were conducted. 
      This approach combined well with the "follow my gut" technique that I was already very familiar with. 
      It raised questions about various aspects of the exhibition design that require knowledge rather than 
      intuition to answer. I have used the first-person perspective study method in my later projects as well.</br>
      I have learned to apply eye-catching and storytelling aesthetics to exhibitions. To attract people and 
      encourage them to experience our design, the exhibition must be visually appealing. Colors, size, and 
      style are the main elements of visual attraction. Lukeâ€™s FMP is a good example of interactive exhibition 
      design. The use of bright theme colors and UX design is very evocative. Aesthetics is also a crucial 
      part of storytelling. In this project, the interaction with the weigh scale is very metaphoric and 
      artistic, creating highlights of the experience. The aesthetics of the tangible artifacts must align 
      with the storytelling. An old-style scale was employed to enhance this effect. Many other factors must 
      be considered to create a good design.</br></br>
