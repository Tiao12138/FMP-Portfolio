      <b>Course introduction:</b><i> Designing for Services</i>,
      In this course, students will learn to recognize, explain, and apply key principles and methods of 
      service design, emphasizing co-design and service co-creation. Through lectures, workshops, and 
      real-world projects, they will explore the strategic role of service design for innovation and 
      organizational change, develop networked systems and structures, and create service design proposals 
      based on collaborative exploration and reflective evaluation with project partners.</br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> User and Society, Bussiness and Entrepreneurship</br>
      <b>Overview:</b> This project aims to help Espoo (city of Espoo) and Trust-M research team in designing a new 
      Service Manual, that will help immigrants to find services for their integration in Espoo. The outcome is a set of 
      service recommendations based on our findings about the lives of immigrant mothers. The recommendations
      can be used for validating ideas when designing the Service Manual. </br>
      <b>In cooperation with:</b>  Emilia Ahlroos, â€‹Kalle Nikula, and Mirte van der Nat </br>
      <b>Reflection:</b>It was my first time to learn theories and methods of service design, and to participate in a real design case in this
      field. I've learned a lot of terminologies and engaged in many conversations with multiple stakeholders with service desigin 
      thinking. I've also learned a lot from organizing the co-creation workshop for the stakeholders and I surprisingly felt more 
      integrated as an international student while gaining knowledge about immigration.</br></br>

      <b>The Bedroom</b> </br></br>
      <b>Course introduction:</b><i> Experimenal Design</i>,
      In this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of the experimental design process and its 
      advantages, learning to execute complex projects from ideation to presentation. Through collective and 
      individual work with different corporate partners, students will organize their creative processes 
      efficiently, generating and documenting a broad array of ideas and translating experiments into novel 
      artifacts that meet diverse client needs.</br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Creativiy and Aesthetic, User and Society</br>
      <b>Overview:</b> The Bedroom is a sound narrative of a bedroom in the feral world of 
      Espoo. It is presented as a digital interface offering a sound narrative that captures 
      the essence of my personal space. Individuals can immerse themselves in the ambient sounds,
      providing a glimpse into my untamed environment.</br>
      <b>Refelction:</b>This project is a whole new and attractive world to me. My past endeavors fall into two buckets:
      one is- "I want to apply this kind of design so tht I can figure out..", the other is- "I use the
      design to enable...(my target group) do... so that they can...". And all of a sudden, it's not 
      about ticking off tasks; I can pretty much explore anything I want. I though, "Ah, this must be 
      contemporary design." But is it contemporary design?  </br>
      In general, it was an amazing experience of trying to express myself freely and to feel the other
      -than-human environment around me with a sensitive heart.</br></br>
