      <b>Course introduction:</b><i> Designing for Services</i>,
      In this course, students will learn to recognize, explain, and apply key principles and methods of 
      service design, emphasizing co-design and service co-creation. Through lectures, workshops, and 
      real-world projects, they will explore the strategic role of service design for innovation and 
      organizational change, develop networked systems and structures, and create service design proposals 
      based on collaborative exploration and reflective evaluation with project partners.</br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> User and Society, Bussiness and Entrepreneurship</br>
      <b>Overview:</b> This project aims to help Espoo (city of Espoo) and Trust-M research team in designing a new 
      Service Manual, that will help immigrants to find services for their integration in Espoo. The outcome is a set of 
      service recommendations based on our findings about the lives of immigrant mothers. The recommendations
      can be used for validating ideas when designing the Service Manual. </br>
      <b>In cooperation with:</b>  Emilia Ahlroos, ​Kalle Nikula, and Mirte van der Nat </br>
      <b>Reflection:</b>My contribution: collaboration & interview: 25%; data analysis: 25%; team meeting documentation 
        and process facilitation: 15%; final presentation & card design: 35%. This was my first experience learning the 
        theories and methods of service design and participating in a real-world design case in this field. I gained 
        foundational knowledge of service design and understood the service-dominant logic1 that service designers work 
        within. I realized that I previously focused on designing service touchpoints, while this group project with Trust-M 
        involved designing at the customer journey level. Engaging in this higher level of service system design provided me 
        with a clearer understanding of how to implement service design into a real service system by collaborating with various 
        stakeholders, including immigrants, NGO cooperators, government communication specialists, the Trust-M service research 
        team, and AI specialists (to develop better digital service touchpoints).</br>
        During the process, I facilitated a co-creation workshop where I learned to prepare comprehensible and engaging materials 
        for different stakeholders. We conducted interviews with stay-at-home immigrant mothers, including those with traumatic 
        experiences. This gave me invaluable experience in communicating with vulnerable groups and maintaining respect when they 
        did not provide the expected answers or were unwilling to talk.</br></br>

      <b>Course introduction:</b><i> Experimenal Design</i>,
      In this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of the experimental design process and its 
      advantages, learning to execute complex projects from ideation to presentation. Through collective and 
      individual work with different corporate partners, students will organize their creative processes 
      efficiently, generating and documenting a broad array of ideas and translating experiments into novel 
      artifacts that meet diverse client needs.</br>
      This year’s theme is “Making sense with more-than-human urban ecologies” where the students are going apply 
    ‘feral ways’ of sensemaking in experimental design research ∞ exploring Helsinki as more-than-human city 
    ∞ investigating m-t-h relations & power dynamics that form the city ∞ who can / has rights to produce 
    knowledge and data? ∞ performative, imaginative, experiential approach: drifting, listening, noticing, 
    crafting, storying, sharing… ∞ co-creating feral data artifacts ∞ spending time with m-t-h ecologies, 
    creatures & ourselves</br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Creativiy and Aesthetic, User and Society</br>
      <b>Overview:</b> The Bedroom is a sound narrative of a bedroom in the feral world of 
      Espoo. It is presented as a digital interface offering a sound narrative that captures 
      the essence of my personal space. Individuals can immerse themselves in the ambient sounds,
      providing a glimpse into my untamed environment.</br>
      <b>Refelction:</b>This project has opened up a whole new and attractive world for me. It feels very 
        natural to fuel the design with our sensory experiences of nature. We applied several creative 
        methods throughout the process. One of the highlights was a tour of a national park, which I consider 
        both a field study and a creative retreat. and I learned that a very effective way of gaining design 
        ideas from the observation of nature is to document the nature trip and reflect on it later. We were 
        encouraged to use the technique of "drifting." The unpredictability of drifting led to unexpected 
        encounters and discoveries, serving as rich sources of inspiration. It also helped me gain a deeper 
        understanding of my environment, leaving lasting and fresh impressions of the places we visited.</br>

        This course and the project felt more like an art practice. It was liberating not to focus too much on 
        achieving design goals, target groups, technologies, or other factors that typically "value" design. I 
        could simply express my personal ideas without needing to explain them. I didn't even have to know why I 
        made certain design decisions, just following my intuition. It was very pleasing to hear others' perceptions 
        of my work, as each design left ample space for open interpretation. This project has been a boost for 
        creativity and a valuable opportunity to explore more-than-human urban ecologies in an artistic way. </br></br>
