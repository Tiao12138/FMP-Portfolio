      <b>Trust-M</b> </br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> User and Society, Bussiness and Entrepreneurship</br></br>
      <b>Overview:</b> This project aims to help Espoo (city of Espoo) and Trust-M research team in designing a new 
      Service Manual, that will help immigrants to find services for their integration in Espoo. The outcome is a set of 
      service recommendations based on our findings about the lives of immigrant mothers. The recommendations
      can be used for validating ideas when designing the Service Manual. </br>
      <b>In cooperation with:</b>  Emilia Ahlroos, â€‹Kalle Nikula, and Mirte van der Nat </br></br>
      <b>Refelction:</b>It was my first time to learn theories and methods of service design, and to participate in a real design case in this
      field. I've learned a lot of terminologies and engaged in many conversations with multiple stakeholders with service desigin 
      thinking. I've also learned a lot from organizing the co-creation workshop for the stakeholders and I surprisingly felt more 
      integrated as an international student while gaining knowledge about immigration.</br></br>

      <b>The Bedroom</b> </br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Creativiy and Aesthetic, User and Society</br></br>
      <b>Overview:</b> The Bedroom is a sound narrative of a bedroom in the feral world of 
      Espoo. It is presented as a digital interface offering a sound narrative that captures 
      the essence of my personal space. Individuals can immerse themselves in the ambient sounds,
      providing a glimpse into my untamed environment.</br></br>
      <b>Refelction:</b>This project is a whole new and attractive world to me. My past endeavors fall into two buckets:
      one is- "I want to apply this kind of design so tht I can figure out..", the other is- "I use the
      design to enable...(my target group) do... so that they can...". And all of a sudden, it's not 
      about ticking off tasks; I can pretty much explore anything I want. I though, "Ah, this must be 
      contemporary design." But is it contemporary design?  </br>
      In general, it was an amazing experience of trying to express myself freely and to feel the other
      -than-human environment around me with a sensitive heart.</br></br>
