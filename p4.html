      <b>Improve skipping experience while watching videos on smart TVs</b></br>
      (M1.1, Q1,</q> Designing with and for digital twins)</br></br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Math, Data and Computing; Technology and Realization; User and Society.</br></br>
      <b>Overview:</b> This project is aimed at improving the user experience of skipping different kinds of
      unwanted clips (product placement as an example) with digital twins when watching videos on smart TV. 
      To achieve this goal, the data of real-world remote control and video playing (video time, video speed, 
      and button state) was colected in the beginning. And then the data was ana;yzed and an initial estimated 
      stop line (where the product replacement will stop) was generated. Finally, the Smart Clip functions was 
      activated  for the video and machine learning was used to optimize the stop line based on users' operations.
