      <b>Improve skipping experience while watching videos on smart TVs</b></br>
      <b>Course introduction:</b> <i>Designing with and for digital twins</i>, the goal of this course is to 
      enable students to explore, understand, and apply digital twins in design processes. Designing with 
      digital twins can transform traditional research, user-centered design, and service design approaches. 
      To develop future digital and interactive products, including the metaverse, students will need a solid 
      understanding of data handling, AI methods, and various design tools</br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Math, Data and Computing; Technology and Realization; User and Society.</br></br>
      <b>Overview:</b> This project is aimed at improving the user experience of skipping different kinds of
      unwanted clips (product placement as an example) with digital twins when watching videos on smart TV. 
      To achieve this goal, the data of real-world remote control and video playing (video time, video speed, 
      and button state) was colected in the beginning. And then the data was ana;yzed and an initial estimated 
      stop line (where the product replacement will stop) was generated. Finally, the Smart Clip functions was 
      activated  for the video and machine learning was used to optimize the stop line based on users' operations.

      <b>Reflection:</b> My contribution: research and team creativity session 30%; prototyping 15%; data analysis 20%; final 
        presentation and report 30%;   
        In this elective, I had my first experience processing data with Python during the machine 
        learning workshops. I realized that coding can be very time-consuming for me, making it crucial to have a 
        holistic plan to complete a project efficiently. I set a goal to quickly build my programming knowledge, as 
        I found that understanding the basic math and computing concepts behind the code isn't too difficult for me.</br>
        During the process, a playback media player was built using the software TouchDesigner. This experience made 
        me consider a strategy for finding the right technology to realize a design. First, I could outline the 
        functionalities I want to achieve and ask ChatGPT for possible software, applications, or technologies that 
        could meet those needs. With those suggestions, I could then conduct further research on case studies, tutorials, 
        or examples of these technologies, helping me develop a clearer approach to design realization. Thanks to ChatGPT.

      <b>What's for Dinner?</b>(individual)<b>/Using advanced AI generate gifts recommendations</b>(group)</br>
      <b>Course introduction:</b> <i>Designing with advanced AI</i>, this course explores the cutting-edge 
      capabilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence for designing innovative systems and 
      experiences. Students will gain a deep understanding of classical ML algorithms and techniques, 
      including supervised, unsupervised learning, and more, and employ these methods to design prototypes for 
      solving real-world problems.</br>
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Math, Data and Computing; Technology and Realization</br></br>
      <b>Overview(group project):</b> Individual project: What's for Dinner? An ML case that the likelihood of a 
      person having different cuisine is predictited using linear regression algorithm. 
      Group project: Using advanced AI generate gifts recommendations. A ML-enabled 
      adaptive system (with its UI design) that recommends gifts based on receivers' 
      gender, interests and hobbies. The primary focus of the recommender system is to provide gift recommendations 
      for the person receiving the gifts. In order to improve the accuracy of recommendation, different machine 
      learning models and parameterws were explored. 
      </br>
      <b>In cooperation with:</b> David Lodder, Niels Winkelman </br></br>
      <b>Reflection:</b> My contribution in group project: Data processing 10%; predictive model building: 10%; 
        presentation & video: 70%. This course primarily focuses on learning various machine learning models and 
        their application, particularly in predictive tasks. We were introduced to WEKA, a free software tool for 
        machine learning and data analysis. While understanding the ML approach and applying it in WEKA is 
        straightforward, working with real-world datasets provided valuable hands-on experience. I learned to 
        redesign datasets, select appropriate ML models, experiment with different approaches, and analyze the results. 
        This practice not only enhanced my data processing skills but also highlighted the importance of effective data
        handling in design projects.</br></br>

      <b>“Tracy”, an in-vehicle voice assistant equipped with multiple modalities</b></br>
      <b>Course introduction:</b><i>Conversational design with multi-modalities</i>, This course focuses on 
      designing conversational interactions to improve cooperation between humans and intelligent machines. 
      Students will learn to create effective, context-appropriate modalities that enhance efficiency and 
      enjoyment while addressing issues of frustration and trust.</br> 
      <b>Expertise Area:</b> Technology and Realization; User and Society</br></br>
      <b>Overview:</b> "Tracy," an in-vehicle voice assistant equipped with multiple modalities 
      specifically tailored for truck drivers. During the design process, a user study was conducted, 
      and the results demonstrate participants' satisfaction with the use and interaction with Tracy.

      <b>In cooperation with:</b> Luca Andraghetti, Davide Stefani </br></br>
       <b>Reflection:</b> My contribution: final presentation and video: 20%; prototype: 35%; user test and data 
        analyze: 10%; process presentation and documentation: 40% </br>
        I like the workshops very much because there I got very practical skills like using Google-dialogflow 
        to build a chat-bot and calling real-time weather information from other websites in the chat-bot. These 
        skills and experiences inspired me and give me confidence to employ AI tools in later projects. Interviewing 
        real truck drivers would have been incredibly beneficial. I realized that collaborating with relevant 
        stakeholders during the problem-definition stage can significantly help in defining the design space and 
        uncovering opportunities.
