             <b>Overview:</b> This design is an interactive installation aimed at enabling participants to 
             create self-portraits guided by their childhood memories. This project draws inspiration from 
             the modern artwork that explores self-image and the therapeutic effect of art therapy, aiming 
             to help people accept their vulnerable feelings through introspection and creative activity. 
             To achieve this, expert interviews with professionals and exploration with generative models 
             were conducted to gather insights and inform the design process. The installation incorporates 
             prompting guidance that evoke personal childhood memories, fostering an emotional connection and 
             self-reflection. The findings indicates that the installation succeeded in providing playable 
             experiences and eliciting positive emotions for people, which is very beneficial in cultivating 
             self-acceptance and helping people embrace their vulnerability.</br></br>

          <b>CREATIVITY & AESTHETICS</b> </br>
          Creativity is about exploring and creating something new with designers’ knowledge and intuition, and  
            aesthetics is about making these creations and explorations visually or sensorially attractive. 
          There are numerous ways to harness our creativity, and understanding creative techniques is essential.  
          Throughout my master's projects, I have practiced various creativity techniques and gained some experience.  
          My favorite technique is the co-creation workshop, which fosters valuable conversations. I applied this  
          technique in the <a href="p3.html">M2.1 Trust-M project</a>, where I learned a lot about organizing such  
          workshops and identifying potential participants. In M2.2, I conducted another co-creation workshop to  
          explore the role of generative AI in the project. This approach proved highly effective and provided an 
          excellent opportunity to engage with users. Other techniques that are very effective and have been applied  
          to other learning activities. In the project “the bedroom” a technique called drifting is often used.  
          it helps reflect on very subjective and personal feelings when I interacted with the non-human elements  
          around me. I used it as one of the techniques that assist design-space-defining and inspiration in almost  
          every project. It helps break existing thought patterns and generate intuitive ideas.</br>
          I've learned the importance of integrating art with knowledge. I've always been interested in art 
          as it reflects genuine human interests and emotions, making design projects both intuitive and 
          aesthetically pleasing. However, to ensure the design achieves its goals and is convincing, it's 
          crucial to have a good argument for the art elements. I have enjoyed conducting precedent studies 
          on self-portraits in my FMP, which has deepened my understanding of how self-portraits can be 
          expressive. This knowledge has enabled me to create more expressive self-portraits myself.  </br>
          Art, especially avant-garde art, contemporary art, and installation art is a good source for 
          inspirational research. inspirational research is another creative technique that I’ve been applying
           all the time to every project that I’ve contributed to. I’ve had inspirational research at any 
           phase of the design process. I think this practice has developed my design thinking and aesthetic 
           thinking at the same time. </br></br>
          <b>USER & SOCIETY</b></br>
          Being an international student has exposed me to cultural differences, significantly broadening my 
          design thinking. This experience has taught me the importance of being respectful and asking the 
          right questions, especially in diverse cultural contexts and when discussing sensitive topics. 
          Rather than striving to confirm hypotheses or expectations, it is essential to accept the outcomes, 
          even if users provide minimal insight or they refuse to speak. Handling discomfort, such as users' 
          negative emotions, is part of the process. The phrasing and selection of questions are crucial as 
          they have a surprisingly huge impact on the responses and the interviewees' thought processes. </br>
          During <a href="p3.html">Trust-M project</a> at Aalto University, I interviewed very vulnerable 
          groups. Some interviewees found it difficult to open up, and some expressed anger. This challenging 
          experience of delving into users' life stories was rewarding, helping me become more confident and 
          relaxed when communicating with users. It also inspired me to focus on a project related to social 
          psychology and art therapy in my FMP. Contributing to meaningful social issues, such as people’s 
          mental well-being and immigrant rights, through projects addressing these problems from different 
          perspectives, has been incredibly empowering.</br></br>
          <b>TECHNOLOGY & REALIZATION</b></br>
          Integrating technology into design realization and building working prototypes is highly beneficial. 
          Although technology wasn't the primary trigger or motivation for my innovation, it has been a 
          significant part of my master's learning activities.</br>
          My skill in utilizing programming languages and constructing circuits has evidently improved. 
          In <a href="p1.html">M1.1 </a>I built a <a href="https://tiao12138.github.io/QUETTA/">react app</a>, 
          which is a pure digital prototype, where data transmission was only within the app between the web
           pages. In <a href="p2.html">M1.2</a> I built a digital music player that is manipulated by physical 
           buttons and a potentiometer. In M2.2 I built a website that integrated hardware, software, and 
           communication with API. The data transmission is mutual between software and hardware and LLM. </br>
          In today's world, where humans heavily rely on computers, having coding skills allows me to realize 
          my design concepts effectively and realistically, drawing on the experience of technology 
          practitioners. </br>
          Technology and realization are crucial for completing the design process. Prototyping with 
          technology involves many small iterations, which are integral to achieving the design goals in 
          meaningful ways.</br></br>
          <b>MATH, DATA & COMPUTING</b></br>
          My learning in this EA is mainly foundational skills in completing machine learning tasks and a 
          deeper understanding of applying generative models. the skills and knowledge help make technology 
          and realization explainable and inform me to choose the optimal tools and approaches to prototype 
          my design concepts. </br>
          I appreciate a lot of small practice in the electives, like building small ML models for specific 
          tasks (course Design with Advanced AI) and building chatbot models(course Conversational Design with
           Multi-Modalities) that are embedded with ML. It constructs the basics and lowers the mental 
           thresholds of applying higher levels of AI. </br></br>
          <b>BUSINESS & ENTREPRENEURSHIP</b></br>
          The <a href="p3.html">Trust-M project</a> at Aalto University 
          was helpful in my development. I worked on a real-world research case, co-creating a design service 
          solution aimed at trustworthy and accessible digital public services for (vulnerable) migrant groups. 
          This experience exposed me to the complexities of designing and implementing city-level services, 
          requiring collaboration between the mayor’s office, universities, government, NGOs, technology experts, 
          and target users.
          As part of the research team, I engaged directly with government employees, learning about the challenges 
          of bringing new services to market and the importance of ethical considerations in large-scale public 
          service design. I also participated in a museum exhibition with the design “The Bedroom”, gaining 
          practical experience in presenting my design to the public. These experiences motivated me to collaborate 
          with experts during my FMP and gave me valuable insights into the industry.
