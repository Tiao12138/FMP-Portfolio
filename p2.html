      <b>Overview:</b> A design research that employs a tangible interface which supports the user study 
      designed to find out whether the embodied metaphor<sup>1</sup> can enhance people's perception of the 
      microtiming<sup>2</sup> in 
      grooves. According to the results, the tangible interface applied in this study does not offer a significant 
      advantage in improving individuals' perception of microtiming in grooves but certain aspects of young 
      individuals' ability to perceive timing in grooves have been identified </br></br>
      <b>Reflection:</b> In general, this was an exciting project for me. The project focused on music grooves 
      which interests me very much, and I had the opportunity to conduct user tests and answer questions that 
      intrigued me. I employed the lab research method. The most exciting part was when users' performances 
      were represented by data and users were eager to know their results. It added a gamification element to 
      the task-based user tests. Because of their motivation, the tests and communication were smooth, 
      efficient, and easy.</br>

      However, I see further opportunities to explore the effect of embodied metaphors on peopleâ€™s perception. 
      More questions could be asked during interviews, which can be conducted as flexibly as possible, even 
      resembling brainstorming sessions. This flexible interview approach can provide unexpected and valuable 
      insights into design evaluation and reflection, and future steps. In this way, more questions and discussions about 
      users' embodied feelings can occur. Since these feelings are ineffable, people often use very different 
      and imaginative language to describe them.</br>
      
      The prototyping process for this project seemed rushed, which caused the tangible interaction less 
      embodied. But it set a goal for my future learning: to improve the quality of prototypes and spend more 
      time refining the models; to understand the methods of prototyping, such as first making a rough model 
      and then creating a final high-quality model.</br></br>

      1 Embodied metaphor: An embodied metaphor is a type of metaphor grounded in our physical and sensory 
      experiences, linking abstract concepts to bodily interactions with the world. For example, the metaphor 
      "grasping an idea" connects the physical act of grasping with understanding, illustrating how our 
      cognitive processes are influenced by our bodily experiences.</br>

      2 Microtiming: Microtiming refers to the subtle variations in timing that occur within musical 
      performances, particularly in the execution of rhythm. These tiny deviations from strict metrical timing 
      contribute to the feel, groove, and expressiveness of the music, often adding a human element to the 
      performance that can convey emotion and nuance.</div></br></br>
