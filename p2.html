      <b>Overview:</b> A design research that employs a tangible interface which supports the user study 
      designed to find out whether the embodied metaphor can enhance people's perception of the microtiming in 
      grooves. According to the results, the tangible interface applied in this study does not offer a significant 
      advantage in improving individuals' perception of microtiming in grooves but certain aspects of young 
      individuals' ability to perceive timing in grooves have been identified </br></br>
      <b>Reflection:</b>Through this project, I have built a tangible user interface that works with the digital 
      interface. I have learned a possible way to transmit data from Arduino to processing, to achieve the 
      communication between tangible and digital interfaces. And a user test was conducted, I had some practice 
      of analyzing the data in a structured and effective manner. In this process, I gained some knowledge about 
      creating good user experience, and got more familiar with basic methods of making physical prototypes with 
      certain materials.</br></br>
